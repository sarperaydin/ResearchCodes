Author: Sarper Aydin


1) The code under the folder DFP-VL is a MATLAB code written for the numerical result of our recent paper,
(Decentralized Inertial Best-Response with Voluntary and Limited Communication in Random Communication Networks found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07079).The main file is DFP_March20.m, you can run the code together with provided other MATLAB functions.

2) The code under the folder DFP-NP a MATLAB code written for the numerical result of our published paper,(Decentralized Fictitious Play in Near-Potential Games With Time-Varying Communication Networks found at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9459777). The main file is dfp_time_varying_new.m, you can run the code together with provided other MATLAB functions.

3) The code under the folder is a Python code written in Jupyter Notebook to produce the results for our paper (Decentralized Learning-aware Communication and Communication-aware Mobility Control for the Target Assignment Problem found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03225).

4) The code whose its name starts with Lake Game, is a introductory code for our recent study on Networked Policy Gradient Play.
